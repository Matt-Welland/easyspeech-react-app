# EasySpeech - React Application using React Speech to aid with family disability

This application was made for my Grandad who unfortunately had suffered from a stroke. He had lost his ability to speak so I have created a speech solution using `React` and `React Speech` to return some normality into his life.

You can view the application here: [https://easyspeech.netlify.app](https://easyspeech.netlify.app)
